 Top 10 Job Recommendations Using LinkedIn Postings + AI
This project is a smart AF job recommender system built using real LinkedIn job posting data!  It combines traditional machine learning (TF-IDF + Logistic
Regression) with powerful transformer-based sentence embeddings (via Sentence-BERT) to recommend the Top 10 most relevant job roles based on a userâ€™s
input/query.
 Tech Stack & Tools:
Data Source: LinkedIn Job Postings from Kaggle
Preprocessing: NLTK for tokenizing, stopword removal, and lemmatization
ML Pipeline: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression with RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
Semantic Matching: all-mpnet-base-v2 from sentence-transformers for deep semantic understanding
Similarity Scoring: Cosine similarity between query and job descriptions (both TF-IDF and BERT style) 
Output: Returns the Top 10 matching job titles based on combined relevance
